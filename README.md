All the art of this project was created by hand by me and is protected by copyright law, which I stipulate through this document which may be freely distributed as long as it is not for any commercial means or included in any product for the same purpose.


Info:
This design was intended to make a more beautiful and clean experience, with no floating characters, consoles or sprites around the screen.
Just the esencial and trying to make a professional and minimal interface, but with a nice impact.
Every system has an iconic game and character so I tried to show that with the controller so you can easily recognize what system you are going to play. Also it has a short description and info about that system.

This is only a Theme I have created for retropie. By using this artwork I assume you have the ownership and rights of all the games you are going to play.
This is a free theme so you can not sell or make money with this.

Game screens are not included. You can see the whole retropie redesign here:
